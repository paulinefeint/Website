    <title>The Best Motherfucking Website</title>

<body>
    <h1> This is the <em> best </em> motherfucking website. </h1>
    <p class="st">Really, it is.</p>
    <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
    
    <p>
        You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB 
        <span style="color:brown">motherfuckingwebsite</span style="color:red">
        (.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="color:red";><U>WRONG</U></span style>
        , motherfucker.
    </p>
    <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    <p>
        Let me describe the  <em>real</em> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past 
        <span style="color:brown">motherfuckingwebsites</span style>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
        <li>
            The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the 
            <a href="https://google.com/">Google home page</a>
        </li>
        <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
        <li>
            Looks 
            <em>almost</em>
             the same on every screen
        </li>
        <li>
            Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem 
            <span style="font size: 6px"> well, kind of</span style > </li>
        <li>
            It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it 
            <span style="font size: 6px"> but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</span style> </li>
        <li>
            Shit is 
            <em> even more </em>
             legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>
             website
        </li>
        <li>
            Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" 
            <span style="font-size : 9px">which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</span style="font-size : 9px">
        </li>
        <li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
        <li>
            Doesn't include any tracking service 
            <span style="font-size : 9px">this website does, but hey, who cares </span style>
        </li>
        <li>
            Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available 
            <em>JUST USE IT</em>.</li>
        <li>
            Use 
            <em>some</em>
             fucking 
            <span style="color:blue">color</span style>. </li>
        <li>
            Links don't really need to keep that 
            <span style="color:blue"> shitty blue</span style>
             the browser is giving them: nor that 
            <span style="color:purple">violetish color</span style>
             when they are marked as visited. Just give them a 
            <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa"><span style="color:#0077aa" > nice color</span style></a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
    <p>
        This website is even better than the last 
        <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">guy</a>
         and the 
        <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>
        .
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It's over a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a>
             - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses one of the most general 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a>
             available out there: .website
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out 
            <a href="http://domainr.com/">domainr</a>
             to do something cool too.
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses the kickass 
            <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>
             CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)
        </li>
        <li>
            It runs on 
            <a href="https://nginx.com/">nginx</a>
            : the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses 
            <a href="js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js">a custom version</a>
             of the awesome 
            <a href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a>
            <strong>/s</strong>>
        </li>
        <li>
            It doesn't use a single media query 
            <span style="font-size":9px>well, not really</span style>
        </li>
        <li>
            It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from 
            <a href="https://microsoft.com/ie">the crap he uses</a>
             to 
            <a href="https://mozilla.com/firefox">a much cooler browser</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript 
            <img src="static/dd60b11e9762b6e25f6d4ce981a1eeae.svg" title="JavaScript logo" height="0.5em">
            , CSS3 
            <img src="static/45e80336c935b524911a6d3f3767448d.svg" title="CSS3 logo" height="0.5em">
             and HTML5 
            <img src="static/cff75e1839f9200f5b983ebbfbaa65ee.svg" title="HTML5 Logo">
        </li>
        <li>
            It supports 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a>
        </li>
        <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once</li>
        <li>
            It uses 
            <a href="https://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>
            , a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)
        </li>
        <li>
            It allows universal access from every website via 
            <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            It is 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">Accessible</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            It's Open Source, freely available on 
            <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">Github</a>
            , and everybody can contribute to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            It uses the 
            <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>
            , which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:
            <p class="fakepre">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
    <p>
        Yeah, a 
        <span class="foufoufou">#444 is cool</span>
         but a 
        <span class="foufivfoufivfoufiv">#454545 is better</span>
        .
    </p>
    <p>
        We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a 
        <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
        .
    </p>
    <h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
    <p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>
    <h2>Put some pictures</h2>
    <div class="fancyPositioning">
        <div class="picture-left">
            <figure>
                <img src="chaton.jpg" title="A nice and cute cat" alt="white and gray cat looking at you, with his blue eyes">
                <figcaption>A cat, just to keep the context of the website.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <div class="tleft">
            <p>
                We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a 
                <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
                 so include some pictures to give a context.
            </p>
            <p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>
            <p>You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>
    <p>
        But this doesn't mean you should load your 
        <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
         with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users, 
        <less>requests (with a small size) = faster load time!</less>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <span>Good design is as little design as possible.</span>
        <author>Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</author>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        That's not entirely true, look at that 
        <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>
        . It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.
